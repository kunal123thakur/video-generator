    "- Single male yogi, age 28-35, lean-athletic, light brown skin, short black hair tied in a small topknot.\n",
    "- Outfit: simple saffron dhoti and shawl; rudraksha mala; tilak (vertical) on the forehead.\n",
    "- Skin texture consistent, no scars; calm facial features; light stubble; same proportions in every shot.\n",
    "\n",
    "SET & PROPS:\n",
    "- Location: vast Himalayan cave temple, stone pedestal with a small circular yantra engraved.\n",
    "- Ambient elements: soft volumetric sun rays from a cave opening, slow-moving dust motes, faint mist on floor.\n",
    "- Occasional props: floating damru (small two-headed drum) materializes with soft particles; no other new props.\n",
    "\n",
    "CAMERA, LENS & GRADE:\n",
    "- Cinematic, 60fps, smooth gimbal/dolly moves, shallow depth of field for close-ups.\n",
    "- Naturalistic, hyper-realistic animation (not cartoon), subtle film grain, gentle bloom on highlights.\n",
    "- Color grade consistent: warm golds and deep blues; high dynamic range; soft contrast.\n",

    "AUDIO/FX INTENT (visual-only guidance):\n",
    "- Silent ambience implied, low heartbeat-like pulse during focus beats (no literal text on audio unless platform supports).\n",
    "- Visual focus cues: breath fog, chest rise subtly, heat shimmer, particle swirls.\n",
    "\n",
    "MOTIVATION THEME (for students):\n",
    "- Visual metaphor of focus, discipline, silence, and clarity.\n",
